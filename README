Folders in core are loaded in alphabetical order due to how fs.list works. As a workaround, loading sequence is managed
by grouping folders and ordering the groups. Folders in the same group do not depend on each other. Later groups depend on
functions found in earlier groups. the latest group has no pre-appended _underscores. Folders in the earliest group have the most
pre-appended _underscores.

When a group access methods of another group, they must use the format <filename>.<function>. If you want to, you can avoid this by
spilling the packages at compile time. This can be done by adding a line in the import.check_for_spills function. For instance,
the 'learn' package is spilled by default. All you need to know is the full path of the package (Hint: run tt, and it'll print
the full paths as it imports).
